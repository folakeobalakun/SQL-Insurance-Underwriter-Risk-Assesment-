# Insurance Underwriter Risk Assesssment 

### Tool used - MySQL

A focused SQL project that answers eight underwriting and operational-risk questions an insurer typically asks before policy renewal . The analysis extracts and summarizes data across staff, stores, inventory, customers, films, rentals, and payments to provide decision ready metrics.

## Questions
1. **Staff directory:** list all staff (first name, last name, email) and their store ID.
2. **Inventory coverage:** separate counts of inventory items held at each store.
3. **Active customers:** count of active customers for each store.
4. **Email exposure:** total count of customer email addresses stored (breach liability baseline).
5. **Content diversity:**
      - unique film titles in inventory at each store;
      - count of unique film categories offered.
6. **Replacement cost profile:** least, most, and average replacement cost for films carried.
7. **Payments risk baseline:** average payment amount and maximum payment processed.
8. **Customer engagement:** list all customers with lifetime rental counts, sorted by highest volume
 

##1. We will need a list of all staff members, including their first and last names, email addresses, and the store identification number where they work.
