2. **Inventory coverage:** separate counts of inventory items held at each store.
3. **Active customers:** count of active customers for each store.
4. **Email exposure:** total count of customer email addresses stored (breach liability baseline).
5. **Content diversity:**
      - unique film titles in inventory at each store;
      - count of unique film categories offered.
6. **Replacement cost profile:** least, most, and average replacement cost for films carried.
7. **Payments risk baseline:** average payment amount and maximum payment processed.
8. **Customer engagement:** list all customers with lifetime rental counts, sorted by highest volume
